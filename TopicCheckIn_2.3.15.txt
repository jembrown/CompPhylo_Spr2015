Probability and Inference
-------------------------

Be able to (roughly) define and explain the significance of:

Sample spaces
Outcomes
Events
Trials
Random Variables
Sampling with(out) replacement
Binomial coefficient
Discrete Random Variables
Continuous Random Variables
Probability Mass (Distribution) Functions
Cumulative Distribution Functions
Support (of a Random Variable)
Conditional Probability and the Independence of Random Variables
Likelihood Functions
Maximum Likelihood Estimates
Likelihood Ratios
*Likelihood Principle
i.i.d.
Mean
Variance

Answer questions like these:

How do we define probabilities? What properties must they have?
How do we interpret probabilities? There are two major schools of thought on this.
How do events relate to outcomes?
How do random variables relate to events?
How are discrete and continuous random variables different?
How are likelihoods the same as/different from probabilities? 
How is the binomial related to the Poisson?
How is the geometric related to the exponential?
How are the Poisson and exponential related? [Hint: In the same way as the binomial and geometric.]

Be able to explain when these distributions are relevant and have a sense for their behavior:

Bernoulli
Binomial
Uniform (discrete and continuous)
*Poisson
Geometric
*Exponential
