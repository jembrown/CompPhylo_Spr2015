*** Sequence Manipulation Exercise ***

- Create a new Python script (text file)
- At the beginning of the script, define a DNA sequence (taken from 
https://github.com/jembrown/CompPhylo_Spr2015/blob/master/CodingSeq.txt)
- Print the length of the sequence to the screen along with text explaining 
the value
- Create and store the RNA equivalent of the sequence, then print to screen.
- Create and store the reverse complement of your sequence, then print to 
screen.
- Extract the bases corresponding to the 13rd and 14th codons from the 
sequence, then print them to the screen.
- Create a function to translate the nucleotide sequence to amino acids 
using the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code (available from 
https://github.com/jembrown/CompPhylo_Spr2015/blob/master/VertMitTransTable.txt).
- Translate the sequence and print it to the screen.
- Be sure you've added comments to explain what this script is and what the 
different bits of code mean.
- Save this script as "seqManip.py" and commit it to your class GitHub repo.
