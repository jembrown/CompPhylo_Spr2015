Exercise 6 - Creating and Using Node and Tree Classes
@author: jembrown

Below is the beginning of a Node class definition and a simple example of how
to link nodes to form a tree. Use this as a springboard to start thinking about:

- What other attributes of a Node might we like to store?
- How do we define a Tree class? What attributes should it have?

- Can you write a function to print out a parenthetical tree string 
   (e.g., ((spA,spB),spC)) if the only argument passed to the function is a
   root node? This will require recursion.

# ---> Defining Node and Tree classes <---

class Node:
    
    def __init__(self,name="",parent=None,children=None):
        self.name = name
        self.parent = None
        if children is None:
            self.children = []
        else:
            self.children = children
        
        
        
# ---> Creating and linking nodes <---
 
# Creating nodes to build this simple three-taxon tree: ((spA,spB),spC)
       
#  spA     spB  spC
#    \    /     /
#     \  /     /
#      \/     /
#       \    /
#        \  /
#         \/
#         |

# Define the root node to start. It currently has no parents or children.
root = Node("root") 

# Define a node for species C. It is a direct descendant of the root.
spC = Node("Species C",parent=root)
root.children.append(spC)   # Adds spC as a child of the root

# Define a node for the ancestor of species A and B, descending from the root.
ancAB = Node("ancAB",parent=root)
root.children.append(ancAB)
spA = Node("Species A",parent=ancAB) # Creates spA with ancAB as its parent.
spB = Node("Species B",parent=ancAB) # Creates spB with ancAB as its parent.
ancAB.children.append(spA)
ancAB.children.append(spB)


print("ancAB's children: ")
for child in ancAB.children:
    print child.name
    
print("")
print("root's children: ")
for child in root.children:
    print child.name

# Play around with nodes and see if you can build more complicated trees!


# Eventually, we will want to create a Tree class, where a parenthetical tree
# string is passed as an argument to the constructor and it automatically creates
# all the nodes and links them together. Start thinking about how to do that.
